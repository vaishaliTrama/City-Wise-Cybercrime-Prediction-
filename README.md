Developed a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict city-wise cybercrime trends based on historical data. The project involved data preprocessing, splitting the dataset
into training and testing sets, and training the model to classify records by city. Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and identified key patterns in city-level cybercrime 
activity. This project demonstrates proficiency in data handling, machine learning workflows, and predictive modeling to support law enforcement in resource allocation and crime prevention.
